This website will host some useful tutorials for things in the ETAL, I wrote these guides to serve as training material for new technicians and refreshers for the rest of us who sometimes forget what we were doing or how things are done. Because I based this website on the Riverscapes theme there are some broken links that would lead to places if this were a proper Riverscapes site, however, because it's not the links are broken. The tutorials will still be useful and those links will work but some of the smaller "accoutrement" buttons may not.
