This has been split into three sections:

[Digitizing in QGIS](https://leallysmith.github.io/ETALHowTo/Digitizing%20Riverscapes/overallguide.html) which will explain the basic mechanics of using QGIS to digitize geomorphic units

[Shapefiles](https://leallysmith.github.io/ETALHowTo/Digitizing%20Riverscapes/shapefile.html) which will list out and explain each of the shapefiles you'll need to make. This will include a list of fields and what types those fields should be, what it is you're mapping and why you're mapping it, and also lines of evidence that you can use to guide your decision making process.

[Tips & Tricks](https://leallysmith.github.io/ETALHowTo/Digitizing%20Riverscapes/tips&tricks.html) which contains tips, tricks, and troubleshooting to help streamline your experience.

[This webmap](https://leallysmith.github.io/LCTWebmap/#9/40.3109/-114.7453) contains all the LCT data which will help you get a look at what other technicians have mapped. You may notice that some of the data doesn't quite line up with the imagery and that is because we generally use drone imagery which is more up to date than google imagery. If you want a more detailed look, you can click on the layer and it'll display the site id which will help you track down the correct orthomosaic on Box, for your reference these are all LCT June or September 2022 sites. You may also notice that some of the symbology doesn't quite align with what our standards are, this is due to my limited ability in javascript. Again, please use the site id to take a closer look if you so desire. Finally, if you use this webmap on a smaller screen you may find it necessary to scroll the map to access the right side menu which will allow you to toggle different layers off and on.
